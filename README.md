PrettyWeb
=========

The internet is made of text, and a lot of it isn't formatted nicely.

[Markdown] and [CommonMark] are markup "languages" that look similar to how people format plain text anyways. This plugin automatically reads any text in `<pre>` tags and attempts to format it using [CommonMark].

The Importance Of PrettyWeb
---------------------------

Humans tend to *emphasize* **words** in certain ways, which Markdown supports.

### Even emphasis like this is supported!

> But why is this so nice?

- Automatically convert plain-text files
- Support [CommonMark], the attempt at a well-specified Markdown language
- Make the web just a tiny bit nicer looking

```bash
# Even code looks prettier!
rm -rf / --no-preserve-root
```
